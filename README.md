Project Title: Mini-Database

Project Description:
Users can enter a word to be searched for, if the word is in the database, the program will display the definition of that word
for the user to view in the designated display area. If the word is not found in the database, a message telling the user it is not
found will appear. There will also be a section of the display showing what words are available with a definition. There will also be a
banner over the definition page which can expand into a full screen display as well.

Functional Requirements:
- A button on the welcome page which takes you to the definition page
- A button on the welcome page which takes you to the weather page
- A button which takes the input from the entry field to check if it has the word/definition in the database
- A banner which shows the live weather in your area
- A button which expands the weather banner into a full screen mode
- A button that minimizes the weather banner and hides it on the screen
- A button which lets user return to home screen after searching
- A button that takes a user to the main menu from the weather page
- A button/option to get a random word and definition
- A button that creates a pop-up or takes you to a page which explains how the search works
- A entry field and button to add a definition to the definition bank
